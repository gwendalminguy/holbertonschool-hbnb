# Part 2: Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

This second part of the HBnB Project focuses on the implementation the application, by building the Presentation and Business Logic Layers of the application. It consists in creating the structure of the project, building the main classes, and implementing API endpoints using Python's Flask framework.

## Objectives

* Implementing the Business Logic Layer
* Building RESTful API Endpoints
* Testing and validate-ing the API

## Directory Structure

| File | Description |
| :---- | :--------- |
| [`app/`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/app/) | Directory containg the HBnB application. |
| [`scripts/`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/scripts/) | Directory containing scripts to initialize the database. |
| [`tests/`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/tests/) | Directory containing scripts to test all API routes. |
| [`config.py`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/config.py) | Configuration file for the application. |
| [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/requirements.txt) | Text file listing requirements for installation. |
| [`run.py`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/run.py) | Python script to run the application. |

## Tasks

**0. Project Setup and Package Initialization**
- Setting up the structure for the Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence layers.
- Preparing the project to use the facade pattern for communication between layers.
- Implementing the in-memory repository to handle object storage and validation.

**1. Core Business Logic Classes**
- Implementing the classes based on the project design.
- Ensuring relationships between entities are correctly implemented.
- Handling attribute validation and updates according to the requirements.

**2. User Endpoints**
- Setting up the POST, GET, and PUT endpoints to manage users.
- Implementing the logic to handle user-related operations in the Business Logic layer.

**3. Amenity Endpoints**
- Setting up the POST, GET, and PUT endpoints to manage amenities.
- Implementing the necessary logic to handle amenity-related operations in the Business Logic layer.

**4. Place Endpoints**
- Setting up the POST, GET, and PUT endpoints to manage places.
- Implementing the logic to handle place-related operations in the Business Logic layer.
- Implementing validation for specific attributes like price, latitude, and longitude.

**5. Review Endpoints**
- Setting up the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints to manage reviews.
- Implementing the logic to handle review-related operations in the Business Logic layer.
- Implementing validation for specific attributes like the text of the review, and ensuring that the review is associated with both user and place.

**6. Testing and Validation**
- Implementing basic validation checks for each of attributes in all endpoints.
- Performing black-box testing using cURL and the Swagger documentation generated by Flask-RESTx.
- Creating a detailed testing report, highlighting both successful and failed cases.

## Tests

The testing part of this API is separated in two parts :

- Bash Scripts:
<br>
Files containing sequences of cURL commands, in order to test successful methods (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE) for each route (users, places, amenities and reviews). The results of those scripts are printed to the terminal. None of the results should output an error.  Those files are located in the [`part2/scripts/`](https://github.com/Mornac/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/scripts) directory.

- Unit Tests:
<br>
Files written for Python's `unittest` framework, to test the validation of attributes with POST method for each route. These tests ensure wrong inputs raise an error on creation of users, places and reviews. Those files are located in the [`part2/tests/`](https://github.com/Mornac/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/part2/tests) directory.
