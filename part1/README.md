# Part 1: Technical Documentation

This first part of the HBnB project focuses on defining the architecture of the application and creating its technical documentation. It aims at understanding and representing the different classes that will be managed in the project: Users, Places, Amenities and Reviews.

## Objectives

* Creating a comprehensive technical documentation for the HBnB Evolution architecture
* Understanding entities relationships and the importance of identifying them with a unique ID.
* Defining attributes that will be implemented for each class.

## Architecture and Layers

To handle operations properly, the application will follow a layered architecture. It will be divided into:

- A Presentation Layer, allowing users to interact with data from a web interface.
- A Business Logic Layer, that will handle API endpoints to manage operations and permissions.
- A Persistence Layer, consisting in a database to store information with persistence.

## Directory Structure
